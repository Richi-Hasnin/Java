1. Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

Description:

This program takes a temperature input in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius using the formula:
The result is then displayed to the user.

2. Leap Year Checker

Description:

This program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It uses the following conditions to determine leap years:
The year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

3. Odd Squares Series

Description:

This program calculates the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers. The series is computed by summing up the squares of numbers like 1, 3, 5, etc., up to n terms.

4. Alternating Series

Description:

This program calculates the sum of the series:
It alternates between adding and subtracting consecutive integers, up to n terms.

5. Factorial Calculation

Description:

This program computes the factorial of a given number n. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

6. Power Calculation (Base^Exponent)

Description:

This program calculates the power of a base raised to an exponent. The base and exponent are taken as input, and the program multiplies the base by itself exp times to compute the result.

7. Bangla Season Finder

Description:

This program determines the Bangla season based on the given month. The seasons are mapped as follows:

March-April: Spring (Basanta)
May-June: Summer (Grisma)
July-August: Rainy (Barsha)
September-October: Autumn (Sharat)
November-December: Late Autumn (Hemanta)
January-February: Winter (Sheet)


8. Largest Number in Array

Description:

This program finds the largest number in a list (array) of integers. The array is input by the user, and the program iterates through it to find the maximum value.

9. Sort Numbers in Ascending Order

Description:

This program takes an array of numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order. It uses Java's built-in Arrays.sort() method to sort the array.
